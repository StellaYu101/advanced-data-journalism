# Scraping assignment 2

On the following pages, demonstrate how you would find the corresponding HTML element and identify it unqiuely.

For example, on the Highway Patrol page we've been working with, if I asked for the table containing all the accident reports, you could answer with something like "The `<table>` tag with the id `accidentOutput`" or `<table id="accidentOutput">` or anything else that gets across the point that we're looking for the table with that ID. You can also use any other combination of information to ID the table uniquely ("the last table tag on the page" or some such).


1. The table containing all the inmates of the [Boone County Jail](https://report.boonecountymo.org/mrcjava/servlet/SH01_MP.I00290s).

2. The table containing all the passed legislation from the [Missouri Legislature](https://www.senate.mo.gov/19info/BTS_Web/TrulyAgreed.aspx?SessionType=R).

3. The table containing all the minutes of the [Columbia City Council](http://www.como.gov/Council/Commissions/meetings.php?bcid=56).

4. The element containing the mug shot of a detainee in the [Boone County Jail](https://report.boonecountymo.org/mrcjava/servlet/SH01_MP.I00500s?PERKEP=66619).

5. For the last part of the assignment, you're going to use the network tab to eavesdrop on — and modify — a request and response transaction.

First visit the member roster of the [Missouri House](https://house.mo.gov/MemberRoster.aspx), open your Network tab, and click on Boone. You should see a request being made to a page called `MemberGridCluster.aspx`.

How would you modify that request to see House members from Boone County in 2005?

This assignment is due next week, on **Monday, April 15**.
