# Scraping assignment 3

Let's say we want to write a scraper that tracks new legislation passed by the Missouri Legislature.

There are many reasons to do this. Maybe you want to build something that alerts you to new bills. Or maybe you want to track the legislators who passed the most bills during session. Or maybe you want to build a visualization, day by day, of when legislation gets passed.

No matter what, you'll have to scrape [this site](https://www.senate.mo.gov/19info/BTS_Web/TrulyAgreed.aspx?SessionType=R). And that's what this assignment is about.

Your job is to write a scraper that grabs the bill, sponsor, and description from every bill on that page and saves it as a CSV.

A few hints:

  * The code we have already written will be a very useful starting point.
  * The hard part will be dissecting the page in the inspector and figuring out what to scrape. This page is a little trickier than the ones we've looked at, so you might have to be a little creative.
  * Remember: Break the problem down into steps!

This assignment is due in two weeks, on **Monday, April 29**. Please check the code into your Github and add a link to [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13jEoZxDG_G8PnNLWVmazuGPzjBTOlnS4DOx6oLP7xA4/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=116462374319624048534).
